# ToolLibrary

A management system for a shared set of physical tools (wrenches, hammers, lawn mowers, etc).

* The expected use case is for employees to sign in/out tools using their ID.
* The employees in charge of the inventory should be able to add/remove tools from the system.
* Managers should be able to view which tools are signed out by which employees.
* Employees roles in the system should be changeable.
